This project is inspired by Tsoding's series on **Raycasting in TypeScript** on youtube: *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1xEkA46CuM&list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZ08cYW6yqNTWLKqLssw0nm&pp=iAQB* <br>
Also follows **Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial**: *https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html*<br>

**Implemented and planned to implement:** <br>
$${\color{green}[x]}$$ Player movement<br>
$${\color{green}[x]}$$ Wall collision<br>
$${\color{green}[x]}$$ Reading a map from a text file<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Connecting multiple maps<br>
$${\color{green}[x]}$$ Raycasting the walls<br>
$${\color{green}[x]}$$ Loading images to textures and using it to give textures to the walls<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Better wrapper for scene objects connected to images<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Raycasting the floors and ceilings<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add light sources<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Depth-buffering<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add interactible objects<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add a player inventory<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add a hotbar and render what the player is holding<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Improving player movement<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add enemies<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add animated textures support<br>

This project uses SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries. All dependecies are included in the repository.<br>
It uses C++20 and uses mingw64 compiler. To compile and run just run a command 'make' (or 'mingw32_make') and run it with '.\main'. <br>
Project is made for Windows but should be able to run fine with Linux.<br>
