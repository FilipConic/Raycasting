# Raycasting

This project is inspired by Tsoding's series on **Raycasting in TypeScript** on youtube: *https://tinyurl.com/47k396hf* <br>
Also follows **Lode's Computer Graphics Tutorial**: *https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html*<br>

**Implemented and planned to implement:** <br>
$${\color{green}[ \space X \space ]}$$ Player movement<br>
$${\color{green}[ \space X \space ]}$$ Wall collision<br>
$${\color{green}[ \space X \space ]}$$ Reading a map from a text file<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Connecting multiple maps<br>
$${\color{green}[ \space X \space ]}$$ Raycasting the walls<br>
$${\color{green}[ \space X \space ]}$$ Loading images to textures and using it to give textures to the walls<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Better wrapper for scene objects connected to images<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Raycasting the floors and ceilings<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add light sources<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Depth-buffering<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add interactible objects<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add a player inventory<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add a hotbar and render what the player is holding<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Improving player movement<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add enemies<br>
$${\color{red}[-]}$$ Add animated textures support<br>

This project uses *SDL2* and *SDL2_image* libraries. All dependecies are included in the repository.<br>
It uses *C++20* and uses mingw64 compiler. To compile and run just run a command ***make*** (or ***mingw32_make***) and run it with ***.\main***. <br>
Project is made for Windows but should be able to run fine with Linux.<br>
